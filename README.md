  Virtual Labs are intended to augment the learning of
  science and engineering subjects through performing
  experiments. The experiments are designed either as
  simulations or as remote triggered. A remote triggered lab
  allows a user to connect to real equipment using a web
  browser. There are currently around 150 and labs and 1700+
  experiments at various stages of development and
  deployment. They are currently hosted at Vlabs. Virtual
  Labs is an initiative of Ministry of Human Resources,
  India.
