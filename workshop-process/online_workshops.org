* Virtual Labs Workshops
** Overview and Motivation 
  Virtual Labs Team organizes workshops and hands-on
  practice sessions on Virtual Labs (both online and In
  person) for interested Science & Engineering
  Institutions. Training sessions would be conducted for
  faculty members and students of interested institutes upon
  expression of their interest in Virtual Labs workshop.
  
  On the other hand the online version is available at all
  times but is dependent on a good Internet link. Any of the
  1700+ odd experiments could be performed at all times
  providing a good opportunity for continuous usage. Online
  versions should be used together in a college. On
  completion of the demonstrations and hands-on sessions,
  the faculty members and the students would be encouraged
  to submit the feedback form to the Virtual Labs
  team. These forms would be compiled and analyzed for
  further improvements in the Virtual Labs.

   management of the interested Science & Engineering Institutions.
