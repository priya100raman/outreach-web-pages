* Virtual Labs Workshops
** Overview and Motivation 
  Virtual Labs Team organizes workshops and hands-on
  practice sessions on Virtual Labs (both online and In
  person) for interested Science & Engineering
  Institutions. Training sessions would be conducted for
  faculty members and students of interested institutes upon
  the expression of their interest in Virtual Labs workshop.
  
  On the other hand the online version is available at all
  times but is dependent on a good Internet
  connection/link. Any of the 1700+ odd experiments could be
  performed at all times providing a good opportunity for
  continuous usage. Online versions should be used together
  in a college. On completion of the demonstrations and
  hands-on sessions, the faculty members and the students
  would be encouraged to submit the feedback form to the
  Virtual Labs team. These forms would be compiled and
  analyzed for further improvements in the Virtual Labs.

   management of the interested Science & Engineering Institutions.
